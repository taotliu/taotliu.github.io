                under a weighted misclassification loss. 
                Rules comprising a prediction score and an associated threshold, 
                where the score is derived using an ensemble learner.

                KM-ISNI paper published in <em>Statistics in Medicine</em>

                [August 1, 2012] <br>
                This paper explores the sensitivity of the KM curve to nonignorable censoring by extending the index of 
                local sensitivity to nonignorability (ISNI) to the case of a nonparametric survival model. 
                The method involves, first, specifying a coarse-data selection model to describe the association 
                between the failure and censoring processes and then evaluating the slope of the nonparametric 
                survival MLE ordinate with respect to a nonignorability parameter in the neighborhood of the 
                ignorable model. We define the nonparametric MLE of the survival curve for a fixed value of the 
                nonignorability parameter and show in a simulation that ISNI analysis effectively captures local 
                sensitivity to nonignorability. The method measures sensitivity in the sense of identifying 
                functionals of the nonparametric MLE that nonignorability, if present, can affect substantially.
